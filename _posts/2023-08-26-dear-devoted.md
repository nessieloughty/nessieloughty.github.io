_Dear Devoted,_ love is a strange thing, isn’t it? Where does it come from? How does one know when they’ve found it? What does it mean to fall in love? When do we know if they love us back? And worst of all, how do we get over it?

After her break up with Lucian, Camila tries to forget him but she doesn’t seem to be able to escape her brother’s bandmate or her feelings for him. While her friends try to keep her at bay, she falls into a darkness no one should have to see and there’s only one person who can bring her out, herself. As Terra and Caleb face their feelings for each other, Ash is ready to fall in love and face his own fears. And after hitting rock bottom, again, Camila must decide between a fresh new love and a passionate old one.
