My name isn’t Nessie Loughty, and I am not from Scotland. My real name is Daniela and I was born in Portugal in 1998, I’ve moved to Spain when I was a baby and then back to Portugal a couple of years later.

I’ve been in love with words since before I learnt how to read. Ever since I’ve heard about words I’ve made my mother read them out to me. Then I learnt to read and got lost in a sea of filled up pages that I couldn’t get tired of. I was the girl who didn’t leave her home without a book.

Music got a grip on me and was my English teacher for the longest time, it still is to this day, making me fall in love with the lyricism and poetry it conveys. And so writing in English has been a necessity and not a decision I’ve made lightly.

When I moved to Switzerland in 2015 I didn’t know dreams can become reality if you set yourself goals and decided to achieve them.

And now I’m the girl who managed to write a book (or two), with things like ADHD, aphantasia and ‘making a living’ against her, I’ve gotten this far and I am beyond proud of myself.

If you’d tell me nine years ago that little seventeen year old me would fall in and out of love, that she’d have enough to say and a means to say it, that she’d be able to step into her potential and get it done, I wouldn’t believe you. I wouldn’t even believe you if you told me I’ve made it all the way to 25, much less that I’d be here trying to put down who I am and what I am doing in this page.

My father once said that I’m the best parts of each of my parents, and he was right. For my father taught me to dream big and my mother showed me how to work hard. Thanks to those beautiful characteristics I share with them you’re able to hold this book in your hands. It took me a while but combining my passion for music and words I’ve found a story to tell and it belongs to you now.
